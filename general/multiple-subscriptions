Our accounts do not support monitoring different servers at different subscription levels.  Only one subscription is available for an account.  

To monitor hosts at different product levels you will need to first create separate accounts for each product level. You can sign up for more than one account with the same user id (email address).  Then in each hosts newrelic.yml file place the license key from the corresponding account.  You specify multiple license keys in one newrelic.yml file by putting them under different `RAILS_ENV` sections.

When a user logs in to the system, they can choose which hosts to monitor by switching accounts using the "Switch Account" menu option in the top right hand corner.
