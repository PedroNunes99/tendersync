There isn't a way to change the host name, however you can create any number of "clusters" which you can name. For example, if hosts ey01-s00057 and ey01-s00058 are both part of a production tier, I can create a cluster called "Production" and add those two hosts to it.
In all parts of RPM where you visualize hosts, any defined clusters will also show up.
