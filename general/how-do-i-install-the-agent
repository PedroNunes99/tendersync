## Install a copy of the Latest Agent

You can install the latest released version of the Agent with the command:

    script/plugin install http://newrelic.rubyforge.org/svn/newrelic_rpm

This will export the plugin into your local directory.

## Updating to the Latest Agent

We recommend completely blowing away the old agent plugin before reinstalling. To do this for a SVN environment, execute the following commands:

     cd vendor/plugins
     svn rm newrelic_rpm
     svn commit -m "upgrading newrelic" 


For other source code control environments, you'll need to do something equivalent.

Then, to upgrade to the latest agent, first update the plugin in your application by executing the following command:

    script/plugin install http://newrelic.rubyforge.org/svn/newrelic_rpm --force

Next, you'll need to double-check that your Agent configuration file (`config/newrelic.yml`) is up to date. To do this, you'll need to do a visual inspection of the default `newrelic.yml` file that lives in the Agent plugin folder (`vendor/plugins/newrelic_rpm/newrelic.yml`). Look for new configuration options that aren't in your `config/newrelic.yml` file.

Finally, make sure to add the new plugin to your source code control system. For SVN, you would execute:

    cd vendor/plugins
    svn add newrelic_rpm
    svn commit -m "installing latest version of newrelic"

## Link to the Latest Agent

You can create an `svn:externals` link to the agent which will ensure your New Relic agent is updated to the latest version everytime you check out or deploy your application.

The installation command is similar to the normal “one time” export:

    script/plugin install -x http://newrelic.rubyforge.org/svn/newrelic_rpm

## Using an Earlier Agent Version 

You can see earlier versions of the agent using this subversion URL:

    http://newrelic.svn.beanstalkapp.com/rpm/projects/Agent/tags

to install a previous version, first remove your current version using

    script/plugin remove vendor/plugins/newrelic_rpm

Then install the earlier version using the subversion export command. Do not use the plugin installation script.

    svn export http://newrelic.svn.beanstalkapp.com/rpm/projects/Agent/tags/VERSION vendor/plugins/newrelic_rpm
