The New Relic Agent gets its configuration from the file `config/newrelic.yml`. This file is installed automatically when the plugin is installed. The plugin gets a reference copy of this from from the plugin location `newrelic_rpm/newrelic.yml`. When you update to new versions of the plugin, be sure to examine or diff `config/newrelic.yml` and `newrelic_rpm/newrelic.yml`. Updating the plugin does not automatically update `config/newrelic.yml`.

The `newrelic.yml` file is a standard yaml configuration file. There is a defaults section at the top, and sections below for each environment (e.g. Development, Testing and Production).

<a name="General"></a>
## General Configuration

**license_key** - this is where the key from your RPM account goes. The key is used to locate the correct account to store data into when the agent connects to RPM

**app_name** - this is the name of your application. The name is used to create an automatic "application definition" in RPM

**enabled** - this sets whether or not the RPM agent is enabled

**apdex_t** - *New in RPM 1.3* sets the 'T' value, the response time threshold for a satisfying transaction, for this application's apdex score. The default is 1.0 seconds. Read more about [Apdex](http://support.newrelic.com/faqs/general/apdex).

**log_level** - this sets the log level

**ssl** - this sets whether or not to use SSL when communicating with RPM

**proxy_host** - this sets the proxy host (if any)

**proxy_port** - this sets the proxy port (if any)

**proxy_user** - this sets the proxy user (if any)

**proxy_pass** - this sets the proxy password (if any)

**capture_params** - this sets whether transaction tracer and error collector should capture HTTP parameters and transmit them to RPM

<a name="Transaction_Tracer"></a>
## Transaction Tracer (Silver and Gold levels only)

These options are indented under the key `transaction_tracer:`

**enabled** - this sets whether transaction tracer is enabled or not. This only works for silver or gold subscription levels

**transaction_threshold** - this sets the threshold (in seconds) for which transaction traces are collected. If unspecified, the default is 2.0 seconds. You can also specify the string "apdex_f", which will set the threshold to four time the **apdex_t** value, which means all frustrating transactions will be recorded. Read more about the Apdex T value and frustrating transactions on the [Apdex page](http://support.newrelic.com/faqs/general/apdex).

**record_sql** - chooses which SQL recording policy to use. Options are 'off', which records nothing, 'obfuscated', which records an obfuscated version of the SQL, or 'raw', which records the SQL exactly as it is issued to the database

**stack_trace_threshold** - sets the threshold (in seconds) for which slow queries collect a stack trace of the calling code.

**explain_enabled** - when true, capture EXPLAIN statements for slow SQL queries

**explain_threshold** - SQL queries slower than this threshold (in seconds) have an EXPLAIN plan captured

  <a name="Error_Collector"></a>
## Error Collector

These options are indented under the key `error_collector:`

**enabled** - sets whether or not error collector is enabled

**capture_source** - sets whether or not to capture source code with ActionView errors
