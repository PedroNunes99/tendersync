## Overview Page

The home page shows a list of all of the agents managed by RPM for the logged in user’s account. It also provides some features that allow account administrators to customize RPM to suit their needs,

* status is reported for the last 5 minutes of application activity, which is essentially considered near-realtime
* RPM designates a unique mongrel instance for each mongrel listening on its own TCP port. RPM aggregates all of the mongrels running on a specific host so you can automatically see the performance activity of all the mongrels on a given host.
* Similarly, RPM can monitor Thin instances, broken out by either Unix Socket or TCP port.
* if you are an account administrator, you can define clusters, which aggregate the performance data from any number of mongrels, all rolled up into one aggregate. You could, for example, define a cluster for your overall production environment, and another cluster for the staging environment.
* an account admin can also specify the threshold settings that govern the red/yellow/green status for each of the traffic lights in the page. For the first release of RPM, these threshold settings are global to the account and apply equally to each monitored agent or cluster
* if an agent has not reported data into RPM in the last 6 hours, then it will not be visible in this page. To see that agent again, restart the agent’s mongrel process in production mode with the New Relic agent installed and enabled.

What the reported values mean

* CPU (by host) measures the sum of every mongrel process’s CPU utilization, but then averages out by host. For example, for a cluster with 6 mongrels, 3 on each of 2 hosts, and each of those mongrel processes is consuming 10% CPU, then this page would show a CPU utilization value of 30%. This helps with setting thresholds, since a danger value of say 60% should be consistent regardless of how many hosts the mongrels are running on.
* Mem (by host) measures the sum of real memory consumed by all of the mongrel processes, again averaged out by host.
* Resp Time (total) measures the aggregate response time of all controller actions in every mongrel in a given cluster/host, in milliseconds
* Load (total) measures the number of controller actions executed by all of the mongrels in the given cluster/host, in Calls per Minute (referred throughout RPM as ‘cpm’).
* DB (by host) measures the percentage of wall clock time spent in the [Object-Relational Mapping layer]  (activerecord-page#Overview), which is a good proxy for database utilization. Again, this is averaged out by host so that percentages tend to make more sense regardless of how many hosts are managed. Note that it is possible to have DB exceed 100. For example, if you have 3 processes on one host, and each spends 30 seconds of the last minute waiting on the database, then the DB would be (3×30 / 60 = ) 150%.

## Navigation 

Most of the items on this page hyperlink to deeper information for the user’s investigation. For example clicking on the name of a host or a cluster, the user drills down into an overview page for that particular host or cluster.

At the right edge of each host/cluster row is a select box that is used throughout RPM. This box allows the user to select any of the data visualization pages that RPM provides, with the context of the selected agent. Over time, New Relic will provide a greater variety of drill down pages to improve RPM’s data analysis capabilities.
