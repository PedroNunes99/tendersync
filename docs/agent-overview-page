This page provides a high level overview of the performance of a selected agent in RPM. (An agent is either a user-defined cluster, or a host running one or more RPM mongrels, or a singe mongrel instance).

<a name="Navigation"></a>
##Navigation

There are several ways to navigate this and most other pages in RPM, based on what you are trying to do.

    * Each of the graphs on this page and most other pages is clickable, and drills down into other pages that provide deeper information.
    * if you want to see the same overview information but for another agent – either another cluster you have defined, or another host, or even a specific mongrel instance – you can select a different agent in the select box near the top left of the page, below the header.
    * If you want to look at different pages for the same selected agent, you can select any page you like from the page selection pop-up menu, right next to the agent selection menu.
    * the user can always navigate back to the home page, which shows an overview of all managed agents, by clicking on the [Applications] link.

<a name="Agent_Selection_and_Restart_Events"></a>
##Agent Selection and Restart Events

As noted in “Navigation” above, you can select any of your managed agents to view the data presented in most pages from another managed agent. When you select a single mongrel instance, dotted vertical blue lines appear in graphs to represent mongrel restart events. (We do this only at the instance level, since in most clusters, mongrels restart quite often and these lines would overwhelm the graphs.)

<a name="Time_Selection"></a>
##Time Selection

All of the data presented in the graphs in each of the data visualization pages is scoped to a user-selectable time window. That time window is specified in the top right hand portion of the web page.

By default, the user is looking at the last 30 minutes of application activity, but other durations can be selected, up to 24 hours. Also by default, the time window ends with the current time, but the user can look at historical data by selecting a duration and specifying a different end time, by clicking on the end time link and picking a new date and time. ( note:  make sure that you hit the Change button to apply the change). You can also reset the end time to current time by clicking the clock icon.

At our first release, RPM will keep historical performance data for 2 weeks; this data preservation period will likely increase in the future.

<a name="Response_Time_and_Load_Graph"></a>
##Response Time and Load Graph

Shows the aggregate response time for all of the controllers actions in the selected agent, and overlays the load (invocation rates) for all of the controller actions in the application, in requests per minute (rpm).

<a name="Database_Activity_Graph"></a>
##Database Activity Graph

Shows the aggregate wall clock time percentage used in ORM find and save operations (e.g. from ActiveRecord, Hibernate, or...).  ORM find activity correlates closely with database query activity.  ORM save activity correlates closely with database insert and update activity.

<a name="CPU_Utilization_Graph"></a>
##CPU Utilization Graph 

Shows the sum of the system and user cpu time consumed by all of the mongrels in the selected agent, averaged out by host. (see details for this in docs for the RPM home page)

<a name="Physical_Memory_Utilization"></a>
##Physical Memory Utilization (MB)

Shows the sum of all mongrels physical memory consumption (as reported by ps), averaged out by host.
