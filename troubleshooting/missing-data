If you aren't seeing data after installing the agent, here are some things you can do to troubleshoot:

* Make sure your agent is up to date.  As the different frameworks and dispatchers evolve, their API's change so older agents can get out of sync with newer versions of Rails, Passenger, Mongrel, etc.
* Make sure you restarted your app after updating or installing newrelic.
* Check the newrelic_agent log files for errors.
* Verify the plugin is installed correctly.
* Make sure newrelic.yml is installed in the config directory.
* If your issue is with the developer mode, make sure you have developer: true and enabled: false.
* Make sure you are on a supported environment (see [the Agent Compatibility Guide](http://newrelic.tenderapp.com/faqs/general/compatibility)) and let us know if your platform is missing.

If you are not finding `newrelic_agent` logfiles in your logs directory, that means either the plugin is not being loaded, or it is not detecting a supported server such as Mongrel or Passenger.

*  Make sure you have write permissions on the RAILS_ROOT/log directory.  There have been cases where the rails app setup sym linked this directory to a /var directory but the admin negelected to change the permissions on the target directory so new log files could be created.
* Make sure the mongrels have restarted.
* Make sure the log level is at least :warn
* Make sure you don’t have the plugins “locked” with the config.plugins override in environment.rb. Otherwise add newrelic_rpm to the list.
* Look in the application log for errors loading the newrelic init.rb file. 
* When installed as a plugin, find the init.rb file under the newrelic_rpm plugin directory.  Uncomment the following line and restart.  Make a note of what this prints out, or if it does not print out anything, and send the result to support@newrelic.com so we can assist in further troubleshooting.

    STDOUT.puts "RPM detected environment: #{NewRelic::LocalEnvironment.new}, RAILS_ENV: #{RAILS_ENV}"

Note: you should change "STDOUT.puts" to `::RAILS_DEFAULT_LOGGER.warn` and then get the output from your production logfile.

If none of these solve your problem, submit a support ticket or email support@newrelic.com.
